### Hi there 👋,I'm Laura

I am new to the world of programming and digital development and I have just started my career in the world of programming.
As I have always been interested in new technologies, a few months ago I decided to take the step and study the Data science bootcamp at the *Ironhack school*.There I learned to work with different OP such as **Linux** , and other softwares like **Git**. However, what I have learned the most about is **Python** (yeap, that's my girl), and its many libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib ...).
