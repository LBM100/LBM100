### Hi there 👋,I'm Laura

I am new to the world of programming and digital development and I have just started my career in the world of programming.
As I have always been interested in new technologies a few months ago I decided to take the step and study the data science bootcamp at the Ironhack school,there I learned to work with different os such as Linux , and other softwares like Git. However, what I have learned the most about is Python (yeap thats my girl), and its many libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib ...)
